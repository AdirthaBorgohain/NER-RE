@Language.factory("scispacy_linker")
class EntityLinker:
    """
    A spacy pipeline component which identifies entities in text which appear
    in a knowledge base.

    Currently, there are two defaults: the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and
    the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) dictionary.

    To use these configured default KBs, pass the `name` parameter, either 'umls' or 'mesh'.

    Currently this implementation just compares string similarity, returning
    entities above a given threshold.

    This class sets the `._.kb_ents` attribute on spacy Spans, which consists of a
    List[Tuple[str, float]] corresponding to the KB concept_id and the associated score
    for a list of `max_entities_per_mention` number of entities.

    You can look up more information for a given id using the kb attribute of this class:

    print(linker.kb.cui_to_entity[concept_id])

    A Note on Definitions:
    Only 187767 entities, or 6.74% of the UMLS KB have definitions. However,
    the MedMentions dataset links to entities which have definitions 82.9% of the time. So by
    default, we only link to entities which have definitions (typically they are more salient / cleaner),
    but this might not suit your use case. YMMV.


    Parameters
    ----------

    nlp: `Language`, a required argument for spacy to use this as a factory
    name: `str`, a required argument for spacy to use this as a factory
    candidate_generator : `CandidateGenerator`, optional, (default = None)
        A CandidateGenerator to generate entity candidates for mentions.
        If no candidate generator is passed, the default pretrained one is used.
    resolve_abbreviations : bool = True, optional (default = False)
        Whether to resolve abbreviations identified in the Doc before performing linking.
        This parameter has no effect if there is no `AbbreviationDetector` in the spacy
        pipeline.
    k : int, optional, (default = 30)
        The number of nearest neighbours to look up from the candidate generator per mention.
    threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.7)
        The threshold that a entity candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc
        as a mention candidate.
    no_definition_threshold : float, optional, (default = 0.95)
        The threshold that a entity candidate must reach to be added to the mention in the Doc
        as a mention candidate if the entity candidate does not have a definition.
    filter_for_definitions: bool, default = True
        Whether to filter entities that can be returned to only include those with definitions
        in the knowledge base.
    max_entities_per_mention : int, optional, default = 5
        The maximum number of entities which will be returned for a given mention, regardless of
        how many are nearest neighbours are found.
    linker_name: str, optional (default = None)
        The name of the pretrained entity linker to load.
